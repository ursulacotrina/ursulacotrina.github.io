Hello, I am Ursula Cotrina. Happy that you visit my page! I received my B.S. in Economics at PUCP and I'm really into Data Science and its impact in several fields such as risk, retail, microeconomics, behavioral economics, regulation and others. Currently, I work as a statistics intern at The Association of Banks of Peru. I also have experience as a research assistant at the Experimental Economicsâ€™ Laboratory from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (LEEX-PUCP) and at Innovations for Poverty Action. About my programming skills, I have knowledge of Python, R, Stata and Julia.

Apart from studying Economics, I like doing volunteer activities like teaching in schools. Besides, in my spare time I like to learn new things like languages and play instruments.
