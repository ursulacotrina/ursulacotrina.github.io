Hello, I am Ursula Cotrina, an economics undergraduate student interested in microeconomics, behavioral economics and regulation. Currently, I am research assistant at the Experimental Economicsâ€™ Laboratory from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.

Apart from studying Economics, I like doing volunteer activities like teaching in schools. Besides, in my spare time I like to learn new things like languages and play instruments.
